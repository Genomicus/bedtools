=intersectBed=

*Note*:  _When intersecting SNPs, make sure the coordinate conform to the UCSC format.  That is,
the start position for each SNP should be SNP position - 1 and the end position should
be SNP position_.

Let's imagine we have three incredibly intriguing genetic variants that we are studying.

{{{
$ cat variants.bed

chr21	9729310	9757478	variant2
chr21   9795588 9796685 variant3
}}}

We are interested in what repeats these variants overlap with in our genome, so we use intersectedBed.

}}}

We find that variant1 overlaps with 3 repeats, variant2 with 4 and variant3 with 6.  We can use groupBy to summarize the hits for each variant in several useful ways.

First, let's find the min and max repeat score for each variant.  We do this by "grouping" on the variant coordinate columns (i.e. cols. 1,2 and 3) and ask for the min and max of the repeat score column (i.e. col. 9).

{{{
$ groupBy -i variantsToRepeats.bed -grp 1,2,3 -opCol 9 -op min
chr21	9719758	9729320	1004
chr21	9729310	9757478	1036
chr21	9795588	9796685	308
}}}

We can also group on just the name column with similar effect.
{{{
$ groupBy -i variantsToRepeats.bed -grp 4 -opCol 9 -op min
variant1	1004
variant2	1036
variant3	308
}}}

What about the *max* score?  Let's keep the coordinates and the name of the variants so that we stay in BED format.
{{{
$ groupBy -i variantsToRepeats.bed -grp 1,2,3,4 -opCol 9 -op max
chr21	9719758	9729320	variant1	3288
chr21	9729310	9757478	variant2	8367
chr21	9795588	9796685	variant3	891
}}}

The mean score?
{{{
$ groupBy -i variantsToRepeats.bed -grp 1,2,3,4 -opCol 9 -op mean
chr21	9719758	9729320	variant1	1588.25
chr21	9729310	9757478	variant2	3620.5
chr21	9795588	9796685	variant3	600.6667
}}}

The median score? You get the point...
{{{
$ groupBy -i variantsToRepeats.bed -grp 1,2,3,4 -opCol 9 -op median
chr21	9719758	9729320	variant1	1030.5
chr21	9729310	9757478	variant2	2539.5
chr21	9795588	9796685	variant3	652
}}}

Now for something different.  What if we wanted all of the names of the repeats listed on the same line as the variants?  Use the collapse option.  This "denormalizes" things.
{{{
$ groupBy -i variantsToRepeats.bed -grp 1,2,3,4 -opCol 8 -op collapse
chr21	9719758	9729320	variant1	ALR/Alpha,ALR/Alpha,L1PA3,ALR/Alpha,
chr21	9729310	9757478	variant2	L1PA3,L1P1,ALR/Alpha,ALR/Alpha,
chr21	9795588	9796685	variant3	(GAATG)n,(GAATG)n,(GAATG)n,(GAATG)n,(GAATG)n,(GAATG)n,
}}}
